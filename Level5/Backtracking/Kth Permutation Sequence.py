# The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
#
# By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,
# We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3 ) :
#
# 1. "123"
# 2. "132"
# 3. "213"
# 4. "231"
# 5. "312"
# 6. "321"
# Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
#
# For example, given n = 3, k = 4, ans = "231"
#
#  Good questions to ask the interviewer :
# What if n is greater than 10. How should multiple digit numbers be represented in string?
# > In this case, just concatenate the number to the answer.
# > so if n = 11, k = 1, ans = "1234567891011"
# Whats the maximum value of n and k?
# > In this case, k will be a positive integer thats less than INT_MAX.
# > n is reasonable enough to make sure the answer does not bloat up a lot.
