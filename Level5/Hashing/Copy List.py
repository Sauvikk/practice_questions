# A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional
# random pointer which could point to any node in the list or NULL.
#
# Return a deep copy of the list.
#
# Example
#
# Given list
#
#    1 -> 2 -> 3
# with random pointers going from
#
#   1 -> 3
#   2 -> 1
#   3 -> 1
# You should return a deep copy of the list. The returned answer should not contain the same node
# as the original list, but a copy of them. The pointers in the returned list should not link to
# any node in the original input list.
